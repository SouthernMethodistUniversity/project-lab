# :white_check_mark: Project Planning is a skill
* There may be workshops available, or they may be those in your community or at your institution who have project management experience or are Project Management Professionals (PMP). 
* Remember your goal, and account for the time, labor (expertise), and money you have available for your project. 
    * There is a maxim that a project can be 2 of the 3 following things (but not all 3): [fast, cheap or good.](https://medium.com/@devsociety_/good-cheap-fast-pick-two-and-how-ngos-can-play-the-triangle-like-a-pro-20d1380884a8)

## What is a DH project? 
* We find it helps to think of a DH project as a iterative and recursive process, not simply a series of outputs. 

### Scoping 
* [How does this project charter handout apply to your project ?](https://github.com/SouthernMethodistUniversity/projectplan/blob/master/sections/charters-handout.pdf)
* How does this apply to a project you have in mind or have worked on in the past?
* Can you fill out any of these sections for your project? *or* Thinking of some of the projects we have looked at, how would you answer these questions for those projects (ex. Viral Texts). 
* How would using this tool for project planing help you in your process?

### :white_check_mark: **Read the following posts before this session.**
* " I'm pretty comfortable with failure because the path to learning runs through failure. It's not something that we think about a lot in the humanities, though in the digital humanities we're getting to a point where I think this is is becoming more obvious. In other disciplines it's much more evident that failure and learning are so closely tied." - [Towards a Taxonomy of Failure](http://quinndombrowski.com/?q=blog/2019/01/30/towards-taxonomy-failure)
* "I have learned a good deal working on this project about iterative, data-driven research, which had I fully understood earlier might have led me to plan its outputs very differently. My edition-building perspective was not ready for the reality of CS research at all." [Talking about Viral Texts Failures](https://ryancordell.org/research/VT-database-fail/)

### Reflection Prompts: 
* How do you think about failure and learning in regards to DH projects? 
*  Good project planning does not guarantee success, but it gives you the best chance of success, or for a 'failure' you can still build upon. 
    * Rafia says: Project planning is as much about managing expectations as it it about successfully completing a porject. 
* Good failure: Research is complicated! You may not answer your question or meet the criteria you set for success as originally envisioned, but the 'failed' project is still generative. Think of it as a learning experience and a foundation that you can build upon.
* Bad failure: failure of communication or planning, does not generate alternate options or possibilities. 
    * If failure is a part of the process, what does that change about how you might approach projects?
