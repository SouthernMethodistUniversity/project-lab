# Summary: **What to do before this synchronous session**

## Scoping 
* [How does this project charter handout apply to your project](https://github.com/SouthernMethodistUniversity/projectplan/blob/master/sections/charters-handout.pdf)
* Can you fill out any of these secitons for you porject?
* 
## :white_check_mark: **Read the following post  before this session.**
* " I'm pretty comfortable with failure because the path to learning runs through failure. It's not something that we think about a lot in the humanities, though in the digital humanities we're getting to a point where I think this is is becoming more obvious. In other disciplines it's much more evident that failure and learning are so closely tied." - [Towards a Taxonomy of Failure](http://quinndombrowski.com/?q=blog/2019/01/30/towards-taxonomy-failure)
* "I have learned a good deal working on this project about iterative, data-driven research, which had I fully understood earlier might have led me to plan its outputs very differently. My edition-building perspective was not ready for the reality of CS research at all." [Talking about Viral Texts Failures](https://ryancordell.org/research/VT-database-fail/)
* * After reading these: 
*   * How do you think about failure and learning in reagrds to DH projects? 
*   * Rafia says: Project planning is as much about managing expections as it it about sucesffuly completing a porject. 
*   Good porject planning doe snot gaurnettee scuess, but it gives you the best chance fo success, or fo a 'failaure' you cna still build upon. 
*     * good fialure (gerentive fialure) versus bad fialue (bridges burned) 
*   * If failure is a part of the process, what does that change about how you might approahc a porject?
