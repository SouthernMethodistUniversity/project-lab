# Sustainability and data management

You will need to come up with a plan for how you are going to manage the "data" created by your project. Data management plans, now required by most funders, will ask for you to list all the types of data and metadata created over the duration of the project and then account for the various manners by which you will account for various versions, make the datasets available openly (if possible) and share your data. 

Sustainability plans require detailing what format files will be in and accounting for how those files and your data will continue to be accessible to you and/or to your audience or a general public long after the project's completion. 

Librarians are your allies in developing a sound data management and sustainability plan. 

## Activity
Very quickly, try to think of all the different types of data your project will involve. 

* Where will you store your data? 
* Is your software open source? 
* What is the likelihood that your files will remain usable? 
* How will you keep track of your data files? 
* Where will the data live after the project is over?
