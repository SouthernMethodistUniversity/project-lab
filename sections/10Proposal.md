## Brief project plan 

* You can have something very lightweight like a Project charter.
    * [Project charter handout](https://github.com/SouthernMethodistUniversity/projectplan/blob/master/sections/charters-handout.pdf)

**Template:** List the following.
* Project title:
* 2-sentence abstract:
* What resources do you have now?
* What have you learned this week that will help you?
* What additional support will you need as you take your next steps?

## Short project proposal (2-3 pages)

* If you are planning a long-term project at scale, or across multiple departments, something more robust like a MOU would be recommended. 
    * [MOU slides](https://github.com/pow123/mouworkshop) 
    * [MOU handbook](https://rc.library.uta.edu/uta-ir/handle/10106/25646)

**Template:** What follows is a template for writing a short project proposal that, once developed, will position you to move forward with building partnerships with other institutions or for pursuing funding opportunities. Though this template does not directly reflect a specific grant narrative format, the short project proposal includes important project-development steps that can later form the basis for a wide variety of grant narratives.

### Project Details
* Title:
* Lead Applicant/PI:
* Funding Opportunity:
* Proposal Deadline

### Abstract

150-word summary of project (1 short paragraph)

### The Need

Statement of the conditions that make the project necessary and beneficial for your key audiences (2-3 paragraphs).

### Impact and Intended Results

A brief explanation that combines your environmental scan and your research goals. Why is what you are doing necessary and different in your field -- and maybe to more than just scholars in your field. (4-5 paragraphs)

### The Plan

Rough outline and project calendar that includes project design and evaluation, and possibly a communications plan, depending on the grant with major deliverables (bullet-pointed list of phases and duration).

* Phase 1 (month/year - month/year):
* Phase 2 (month/year - month/year):
* Phase 3 (month/year - month/year):

### Project Resources: Personnel and Management

Description of why the cooperating institutions and key personnel are well-suited to undertake this work (list of experience and responsibilities of each staff member, and institutional description).

### Sustainability

If applicable, describe how this project will live beyond the grant period. Will it continue to be accessible? How so? A data management plan might need to be specified here.
