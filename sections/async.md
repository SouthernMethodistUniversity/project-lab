# Summary: **What to do before this synchronous session** (8/12/21)

## :white_check_mark: Read the following post.
* "I have learned a good deal working on this project about iterative, data-driven research, which had I fully understood earlier might have led me to plan its outputs very differently. My edition-building perspective was not ready for the reality of CS research at all." [Talking about Viral Texts Failures](https://ryancordell.org/research/VT-database-fail/)

[Now take a look at the Brief Charter handout](https://github.com/SouthernMethodistUniversity/projectplan/blob/master/sections/charters-handout.pdf) and respond to the following in the thread in Slack:
1.	How might the use of this charter have affected their process?
2.	If a charter cannot guarantee success, why use it? 
3.	How is this similar or different than other project planning approaches you have used?
 
## :white_check_mark: Read the following post.

* "I'm pretty comfortable with failure because the path to learning runs through failure. It's not something that we think about a lot in the humanities, though in the digital humanities we're getting to a point where I think this is is becoming more obvious. In other disciplines it's much more evident that failure and learning are so closely tied." - [Towards a Taxonomy of Failure](http://quinndombrowski.com/?q=blog/2019/01/30/towards-taxonomy-failure)

Respond to the following in the thread in Slack:
1.	Do you have an example where you experienced the types of failure described here? 
2.	Which types of failure are most affected by Project Planning? Personnel? Resources? Time?
3.	Are there types of failure that are more permanent than others?
