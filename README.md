 # Project Laboratory

We are going to work out the process for designing your digital research project in this session. Good--or shall we say effective--projects begin with a plan. It's true those plans may change over the life cycle of the project. Your questions may change. Your funding may change. Even the shape your "final" research project takes may change. 

What separates projects that turn into something from those that stall out and go nowhere is the formulation of a **reasonable, informed, and purposeful plan**.

## Why?

Most workshops teach you something: a skill, a method, a practice. But what are you going to do next? Sure, you've learned how to start to use Python. You might have done some text analysis or written your first webpage, but the real trick is figuring out how to take what you've learned, plan for what comes next, and make your project come to fruition. 

None of those things can happen without a plan. If you walk out those doors today without a plan for what your next steps will be, it's unlikely that you'll be able to make much progress. There is no possible way for us to teach you everything you need to know, and there's no way for you to learn anything well enough in one week that you can walk out those doors and do everything you want to do. 

### This session will help you

1. Identify existing resources (and maybe even a few you haven't thought of yet)
2. Identify your needs
3. Create a workplan 
4. Find new resources
5. Communicate your plan

## Process for DHRI
* We will be sharing the links to a Github Repository for each session in Slack before each synchronous session. You can also get to them from the [Curriculum page](https://southernmethodistuniversity.github.io/home/curriculum.html).
* This is the first year where DHRI has been planned to have both asynchronous and synchronous components. Here is how we have organized the content.  
   * As you are reading, we you will see *four* categories of content:
      * Asynchronous Content presentation (unmarked). Please read ahead of time.
      * Asynchronous Activity (indicated by green check mark :white_check_mark:). Please make sure you read this content before a session. Some questions have corresponding Slack channels or discussion, others are just marked so you are thinking about them beforehand as they are topics we will be discussing in the synchronous session.  
      * Synchronous Content presentation (indicated by a yellow dot :yellow_circle:). This indicates a page that has content we will go over together; you do not need to engage with this content ahead of time. 
      * Synchronous Activity (unmarked). We will do these activities together in the synchronous sessions.
* As you read each repository please put questions/comments in the Slack channel. 
* If text appears blue in a repository, that just means it is a hyperlink.
    * These repositories are structured in such a way that they will direct our conversations during the institute, but also so that you can return to them later to review the material. 

## Required before this session (8/3/21)
* All content is :white_check_mark: marked throughout; it is also all gathered on [this page](sections/async.md).
